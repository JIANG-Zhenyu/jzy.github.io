#Question: How have the new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?

#Answered starts in line 63

#Discuss: As can be seen in the graph, the line indicating total cases rose significantly but the line indicating new cases rose and later fell. 
                This outcome indicates that although the total case is increasing, the outbreak in Spain was roughly controled by the government.
